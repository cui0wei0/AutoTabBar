# AutoTabBar
# This is a very simple small easy common View
# I'm also a newbie noob naive young fresh code farmer >_< 
# It's not finish yet! 
# if you want to use this in your project,you have to prepare three arrays.
# one is for ViewController one is for Normal images of tabbar item and one is for the Highlighted
# if you want to change the title color of the item ,you can set the tintcolor for tabbar .
# have fun >_<
